            The aim of this project was to make a simple, flexible tool to calculate the metrics of glycemic control from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data.

            Continuous glucose monitors are an exciting new development in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). These devices give glucose readings every 5 to 15 minutes, providing large amounts of data and providing potential for unprecedented insight into glucose dynamics throughout the day.
            NICE has recently announced that all people with type 1 diabetes will receive a CGM. This dramatic increase in data will provide opportunity for significant advances in diabetes health research, but will naturally result in an increased demand for effective data analysis tools for non-technical researchers and clinicians.

            The [international consensus on the use of continuous glucose monitors](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/40/12/1631/37000/International-Consensus-on-Use-of-Continuous) (CGMs) has identified several metrics of glycemic control that are important for assessing and optimizing diabetes management.
            However, the current platforms on which CGM data analysis can be performed are proprietary, closed source and limited in terms of functionality. The glucose data can be analysed with some basic metrics but cannot be explored in any more flexible or complex ways. Consequently, researchers are exporting the data and calculating the relevant metrics manually, which is extremely time consuming and prone to error.

            The idea of this project began when Cat was approached to try to solve this problem... and thus, Diametrics was born. The WebApp allows researchers to easily calculate the metrics of glycemic control whilst also providing an unprecendented freedom to explore the data further.
            Diametrics can be used to calculate the commonly used metrics of glycaemic control, explore your data through interactive visualisations and break your data down into specific periods of interest.
